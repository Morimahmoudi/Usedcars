# Usedcars
This code analyzes the features related to the prices of 426,000 used cars, aiming to understand the factors influencing a vehicle's price.

# Workflow
The process begins with loading and cleaning the dataset. A linear regression model is then used to assess the correlation between car features and their respective prices. During the initial analysis, the presence of outliers was identified and subsequently removed through code updates. Feature selection strategies, including linear and polynomial features based on Ridge regression coefficients, were employed alongside the evaluation of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² scores after the removal of outliers.

# Outcomes:
Initial Analysis: Following the removal of outliers, MSE decreased while the R² score increased. Specifically, the R² score improved from 0.35 to 0.68 post-cleaning. The correlation heatmap indicated a strong positive correlation between price and features such as "year" and "cylinders," while showing a strong negative correlation with "fuel" efficiency and "odometer" readings. These findings align with expectations, as newer cars with higher cylinder counts typically command higher prices, whereas those that are less fuel-efficient or have higher mileage tend to decrease in value.

Selected Features Analysis: The inclusion of both linear and polynomial (interaction) features suggests the model successfully captures complex relationships between features and price. Key features, such as "year" and "cylinders," and their interactions with other variables, indicate significant impacts on pricing, potentially highlighting non-linear relationships.

Additionally, the reduced MSE from the selected feature analysis signifies improved precision in predictions. This lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are now significantly closer to the actual car prices. The final R² score of 0.77 suggests that around 77% of the variance in car prices can be explained by the features in the model after feature selection, demonstrating a strong model fit. This score represents an enhancement from the initial linear regression analysis, which recorded an R² of 0.68.

The model effectively identified a combination of linear, polynomial, and interaction features that significantly contribute to predicting car prices. The decrease in MSE and increase in R² score imply substantial improvements in model performance resulting from focused feature selection and polynomial transformations.

# Cross-Validated Results
The analysis of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the R² score of 0.77 further supports that the model can effectively explain car prices based on the selected features. This finding strongly indicates the model's ability to comprehensively explain the dataset.

# Recommendations
Considering the insights derived from the regression analysis, the following recommendations can be made for potential used car buyers:

Focus on Key Features:

Year: Opt for newer vehicles, which generally feature improved safety ratings, better technology, and reliability. Recent models are often expected to retain higher resale values.
Condition: Prioritize vehicles that have been well-maintained and are in good condition, as these often provide better long-term satisfaction.
Cylinders and Engine Size: Assess your needs against engine size. More cylinders may offer greater power but also higher fuel costs. Choose an engine size that balances performance and fuel efficiency according to your preferences.
Review Mileage:

Generally, lower odometer readings are preferable. However, consider mileage relative to the car's age; a moderate mileage vehicle that has been well maintained may be a better choice than a low-mileage vehicle that shows signs of neglect.
Consider Drive Type:

Depending on your typical driving conditions (e.g., weather and terrain), the type of drive (such as front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive) can significantly affect vehicle suitability.
Negotiate Smartly:

Use analysis of the car’s features and the market's pricing trends as leverage when negotiating prices. If a car has high mileage or lacks desirable features, you may have a strong case for negotiating a lower price.
When comparing similar cars with different prices, evaluate the differences in mileage, condition, and features before making a decision.
